A simple python script in order to get picks and raw waveforms from seiscomp using SQL and FDSNWS in order to connect with the SW_View software that is not capable of getting data via SeedLink. 
Planned to January (TODO):
1) Re-write from re-fetching ringbuffer miniseeds to ringbuffer miniseed files.
2) Some documentation
